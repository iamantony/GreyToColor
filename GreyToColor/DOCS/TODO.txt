1) Combine in different objects (or paths) classes for image processing, database and so on. Image = image classes + image service
2) Convert RGB to LAB through search table
3) Add ability to use other color spaces

Refactoring:
1) Use C++ everywhere where it is possible. In ideal use Qt for interfaces.
2) Use Boost, OpenCV
3) Write tests for each class. Test only public functions.
4) Graphs drawing: add support for qwt
5) Parallel image processing
6) Repository should not contain databases, images and so on
7) Add app version
8) Qt 5.2 support
